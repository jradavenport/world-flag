# world-flag

I was so inspired by the original [Flag of Earth](http://flagofearth.org/original.html), I wanted to try creating something similar in Python.

- like orignal version, just use simple circles for elegance
- include Sun, Earth, Moon
- colors should reflect something... effective temperatures? 
  - should moon be white or black?
  - also color palette should be attractive to the eye
- aspect ratio should be Pi/2
- radii ratio for 3 bodies should be correct
- inclination of Moon's orbit relative to Earth-Sun orbit should be correct
- ratio of separation between bodies should be correct
